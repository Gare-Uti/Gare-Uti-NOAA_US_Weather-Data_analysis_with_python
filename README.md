# Gare-Uti-NOAA_US_Weather-Data_analysis_with_python
The project is on the usage of python's rich libraries viz- numpy, urllib, math and matplotlib for analyzing  weather station data localized across various cities in the United states. Datasets was sourced from  the NOAA website- https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov. weather variables/parameters such as Temperature (Min and Max), Precipitation etc.were used in analyzing the data over certain times. Project was done on the Jupyter notebook managed by the Anaconda package manager.    NOAA stands for the "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration" a US govt agency. NOAA has its own integrated database called "GHCN" where it stores daily climate summaries from land surfaces across the globe.  GHCN-contains records from over 100000 stations in 180 countries and territories.  N.C.E.I provides numerous daily variables, including maximum and minimum temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth.  Both the record length and period of record vary by stations and cover intervals  ranging from less than a year to more than 175 years.
